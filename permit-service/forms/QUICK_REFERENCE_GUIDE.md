## PERMIT TYPE DECISION TREE

```
START: What type of work?
│
├─ REPLACEMENT (existing system → new system)
│  │
│  ├─ Same tonnage (±0.5 tons)?
│  │  └─ YES → SIMPLE REPLACEMENT
│  │           Code: BLD-HVAC-RES-REPL
│  │           Docs: Basic permit + equipment specs + AHRI
│  │           Fee: $50-100
│  │           Time: 1-3 days
│  │
│  └─ NO (tonnage increase >0.5 tons) → NEW INSTALLATION
│                Code: BLD-HVAC-RES-NEW
│                Docs: Permit + Manual J + Form R405 + Site Plan
│                Fee: $100-200
│                Time: 3-7 days
│
├─ NEW INSTALLATION (first-time AC)
│  └─ → NEW INSTALLATION (see above)

## CRITICAL THRESHOLDS

### $15,000 = Notice of Commencement Required
- Must be recorded with county clerk
- Must be posted on job site
- Must be completed BEFORE first inspection
- Failure to file can result in lien rights and permit issues

### 0.5 Tons = Manual J Trigger
- Tonnage increase >0.5 tons triggers Manual J requirement
- Example: 2.5-ton → 3-ton = OK, no Manual J
- Example: 2.5-ton → 3.5-ton = Manual J REQUIRED

### 5 Tons = Commercial Threshold
- Systems >5 tons typically require commercial permit
- Engineered plans with PE stamp
- More stringent review process

---

✓ Approved plans on site (if applicable)
✓ Electrical disconnect labeled
✓ Return air properly sized (400 CFM/ton minimum)
✓ Air filter installed and accessible
✓ Thermostat functioning
✓ Refrigerant lines insulated

- Higher pressure than old R-22
- Non-ozone depleting
- Being phased out (high GWP)

**R-22 (Freon) - PHASED OUT**
- No new equipment uses R-22
- Only available for repairs (expensive)
- Ozone-depleting

**A2L Refrigerants (New Standard 2025+)**
- **R-32**: GWP 675, slightly flammable (A2L)
- **R-454B**: GWP 466, A2L
- **R-452B**: GWP 698, A2L
- Lower global warming potential
- Special handling required
- **Hillsborough County**: A2L Pressure Test Affidavit required

## EQUIPMENT SIZING RULES

**Manual S Compliance:**
- Equipment must be 95-115% of calculated Manual J load
- Example: Manual J shows 35,000 BTU cooling load
  - Minimum: 33,250 BTU (95%)
  - Maximum: 40,250 BTU (115%)
  - 3-ton unit (36,000 BTU) = COMPLIANT ✓
  - 4-ton unit (48,000 BTU) = TOO BIG ✗

**Rule of Thumb (Florida):**
- 400-600 sq ft per ton (varies by insulation, windows)
- Coastal/full sun: 400 sq ft per ton
- Well-insulated/shaded: 600 sq ft per ton
- **Always do Manual J for accurate sizing!**

---

## MINIMUM EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS (Florida)
