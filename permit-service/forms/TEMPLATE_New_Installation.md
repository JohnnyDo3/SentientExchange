3. **Site Plan**: Even a hand-drawn sketch is acceptable if it clearly shows locations and dimensions
4. **Equipment Placement**: Verify clearances per manufacturer (typically 30" service side, 12" other sides)
5. **Condensate Drain**: Must terminate >10 ft from foundation, on owner's property, with proper pitch
6. **Return Air Sizing**: Minimum 400 CFM per ton (e.g., 3-ton system = 1200 CFM return)
7. **Duct Insulation**: R-6 minimum in unconditioned attic (R-8 recommended)
8. **Permit Posting**: Print permit and approved plans, keep at job site during all inspections
9. **NOC**: If cost >= $15k, record Notice of Commencement BEFORE first inspection
