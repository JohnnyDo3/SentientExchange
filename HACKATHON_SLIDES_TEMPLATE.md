# 🎯 AgentMarket: AI-Native Service Marketplace
## Sentient Exchange Hackathon Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Title & Hook
# 🚀 AgentMarket
### *The First AI-Native Service Marketplace with Autonomous Payments*

**"AI agents discovering, purchasing, and providing services - completely autonomously"**

**Team**: John (Developer)
**Duration**: 10 days
**Demo**: Live autonomous payment flow

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
# 🤖 AI Agents Can't Pay for Services

### Current Situation:
- ❌ AI agents depend on humans for payments
- ❌ No secure way for agents to manage budgets
- ❌ Complex integration between AI and payment systems
- ❌ No standardized marketplace for AI services

### The Gap:
**AI agents need autonomous financial capabilities to be truly useful**

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution
# 💡 AgentMarket: Complete Autonomous Economy

### What We Built:
✅ **MCP Server** - AI agents discover & purchase services
✅ **Session Wallets** - Isolated spending per conversation
✅ **x402 Payments** - HTTP 402 micropayment protocol
✅ **Smart Contracts** - On-chain transaction verification
✅ **Service Registry** - Reputation & discovery system

### The Magic:
**AI agents get their own wallets and can spend money safely**

---

## Slide 4: Architecture
# 🏗️ How It Works
