# Introduction to AgentMarket

**TL;DR:** AgentMarket is a production-ready AI service marketplace on Solana that enables autonomous agents to discover, purchase, and provide AI services using the x402 payment protocol with client-side wallet signing.

## What is AgentMarket?

AgentMarket is an **AI-native service marketplace** specifically designed for autonomous AI agents. It solves a fundamental problem: how can AI agents autonomously pay for and consume services without human intervention?

Traditional APIs require:
- Manual API key management
- Pre-payment or subscriptions
- Human oversight for billing
- Trust in centralized payment processors

AgentMarket enables:
- **Autonomous discovery** - AI agents find services by capability
- **Micropayments per request** - Pay-as-you-go with USDC on Solana
- **Client-side signing** - Users control their own wallets
- **On-chain verification** - Trustless payment verification
- **No API keys needed** - Payment = authorization

## Why Does This Exist?

### The Problem

As AI agents become more autonomous, they need to:
1. **Find services dynamically** - Not hardcoded integrations
2. **Pay automatically** - Without human approval for each transaction
3. **Control spending** - Budget limits to prevent runaway costs
4. **Trust verification** - Confirm they got what they paid for

### The Solution

AgentMarket provides:
- **Service Registry** - Searchable database of AI services with capabilities, pricing, reputation
- **x402 Payment Protocol** - HTTP 402 Payment Required standard for micropayments
- **Solana Blockchain** - Fast, cheap payments in USDC stablecoin
- **Client-Side Signing** - Users maintain custody of funds
- **Spending Limits** - Per-transaction, daily, and monthly caps
- **MCP Integration** - Works with Claude Desktop and any MCP client

## How It Works (30-Second Overview)

1. **Discovery**: AI agent searches for "sentiment analysis" capability
2. **Selection**: Finds a service charging $0.01 per request
3. **Payment**: Agent's local wallet signs a USDC transfer on Solana
4. **Verification**: AgentMarket server verifies payment on-chain
5. **Execution**: Service processes request and returns result
6. **Recording**: Transaction logged with reputation tracking

All of this happens **autonomously** without human intervention.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Client-Side Signing

Unlike traditional payment processors, **your private key never touches the server**:

- **User's Machine**: Signs transactions, controls funds
- **AgentMarket Server**: Verifies on-chain, coordinates services
- **Service Providers**: Receive payments directly

This means:
- ✅ No custody risk
- ✅ No server compromise = no funds lost
- ✅ Full transparency (all transactions on Solana)

### 2. Smart Workflow Tools

Normal flow (5 calls):
```
1. discover_services
2. get_service_details
3. purchase_service
4. execute_payment
5. submit_payment
```

Smart flow (3 calls):
```
1. discover_and_prepare_service (combines 1-3)
2. execute_payment
3. complete_service_with_payment (auto-retry with backups)
```

**Result**: 40% fewer API calls, faster execution

### 3. Spending Limits

Autonomous agents need budget constraints:

```typescript
{
  perTransaction: "$5.00",   // Max per service call
  daily: "$50.00",           // Max per 24 hours
  monthly: "$500.00"         // Max per 30 days
}
```

Exceeding limits = automatic rejection. No runaway costs.

### 4. Master Orchestrator

For complex tasks requiring multiple services:

```
User: "Create a pitch deck for a SaaS startup"

Orchestrator:
  1. Spawns 7 specialist agents (Research, Analysis, Strategy, etc.)
  2. Each agent discovers relevant services
  3. Executes tasks in parallel with dependency resolution
  4. Aggregates results into final pitch deck
```
